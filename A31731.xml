            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Character Of an Old Engliſh Proteſtant; Formerly Called A PURITAN, NOW A NON-CONFORMIST.</head>
            <p>THe Old Engliſh Proteſtant was ſuch an one, that honoured God <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 22.37, 38, 39. 1 Pet. 2.17.</note> above all, and under God gave <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> every one his due. His <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> firſt care was to ſerve God, and therein he did not what was good in his <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 12.8, 32.</note> own, but in Gods fight, making the Word of God the Rule of his Worſhip. He highly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <note n="e" place="margin">Col. 2.5.</note> order in the Houſe of God; but would not under colour of that, ſubmit to ſuperſtitious rites, which are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and <note n="f" place="margin">Verſ. 21, 22.</note> periſh in their uſe. He reverenced <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 13.1.</note> Authority, keeping within its ſphere; but durſt not under pretence of ſubjection to the higher powers <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 15.9. Col. 2.8.</note>, worſhip God after the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men. He made conſcience of <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> all Gods Ordinances, though <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17.</note> ſome he eſteemed of more conſequence. He was much in <note n="l" place="margin">Col. 4.2.</note> prayer; with it he <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 92.2.</note> began, and cloſed the day. In it he was exerciſed in his <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 55.17. Mat. 6. 6.</note> cloſet, <note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 6.20.</note> family, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1, 2.</note> and publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. He eſteemed that manner of prayer beſt, where by the <note n="q" place="margin">1 Sam. 1.15. Rom. 8.26.</note> gift of God, expreſſions were varied according to preſent wants and occaſions; yet did he not account <note n="r" place="margin">Num. 10.35, 36.</note> ſet forms unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Therefore in that circumſtance of the Church he did not wholly <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.20, 21, 22, 23.</note> reject the Liturgy, but the corruption of it. He eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 13.15. Pſal. 1.2.</note> reading of the Word an Ordinance of God both in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publick; but did not account reading to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Word <note n="u" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15.</note> read he eſteemed of more authority, but the <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21. Rom. 1.16.</note> word preacht of more efficacy. <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> He accounted preaching as neceſſary now as in the Primitive Church: Gods <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> pleaſure being ſtill by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave thoſe that believe. He eſteemed that Preaching beſt <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.24.23. 1 Cor. 2. 1, 3, 4, 5. 2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> wherein was moſt of God, leaſt of man, when vain flouriſhes of wit and words w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>e declined, and the demonſtration of Gods Spirit and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtudied: yet could be diſtinguiſh between <note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 2.17. 1 Tim. 4. 13. 2 Tim. 2. 15. Eccl. 12. 9, 10.</note> ſtudied plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and negligent rudeneſs. He accounted <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> perſpicuity the beſt grace of a Preacher; And that <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.25.</note> method beſt, which was moſt helpful to underſtanding, affection, and memory. To which ordinarily he eſteemed none ſo conducible, as that by Doctrine, Reaſon and Uſe. He eſteemed thoſe <note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.1.</note> Sermons beſt that came cloſet to the Conſcience; yet would he have mens Conſciences awakened, not their perſons diſgrac'd. He was a man of good ſpiritual <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.2.</note> appetite, and could not be contented with <note n="g" place="margin">James 1.19.2 Tim. 4.1, 2.</note> one meal a day. An Afternoon-Sermon did reliſh as well to him as one in the morning. He was not ſatiſfied with <note n="h" place="margin">Prov. 28.9.</note> Prayers without Preaching: which if it were wanting at <note n="i" place="margin">Amos 8.11, 12. Mat. 3.5.</note> home, he would ſeek abroad; yet would he not by <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.21, 22. 1 Cor. 4.6.</note> abſence diſcourage his Miniſter, if faithful, though another might have quicker gifts. A <note n="l" place="margin">2 Tim. 4.1, 2.</note> Lecture he eſteemed, though not neceſſary, yet a bleſſing, and would redeem <note n="m" place="margin">Eph. 5.16.</note> ſuch an opportunity with ſome pains and loſs. The <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 16.2. Acts 20.7. Rev. 1.10.</note> Lords day he eſteemed a divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and <note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 2.18.</note> reſt on it neceſſary ſo far as it conduced to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He was <note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 20.8.</note> very conſcientious in obſerving of that day as the Mart day of the Soul. He was very careful to <note n="q" place="margin">2 Chron. 22.20. Pſalm 91.</note> remember it, to get houſe and heart in order for it: and when it came, he was ſtudious to improve it. He <note n="r" place="margin">Ifa. 58.13, 14.</note> redeemed the morning from ſuperfluous ſleep, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Exod. 20.8. Acts 20.7.</note> and watched the whole day over his thoughts and words, not only to reſtrain them from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but worldlineſs. <note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 6.7.</note> All parts of the day were alike holy to him, and his care was continued in it in variety of holy duties: what he heard in publick, he repeated in private, to <note n="u" place="margin">Ifa. 58.13, 14.</note> whet it upon himſelf and family. Lawful <note n="x" place="margin">Exod. 2.6. Mar. 12.17.11.12, 13.</note> recreations he thought this day unſeaſonable, and <note n="y" place="margin">Cor. 17.14.</note> unlawful ones much more abominable: yet he knew <note n="z" place="margin">Acts 16.15.</note> the liberty God gave him for needful refreſhing, which he did neither refuſe nor abuſe. The Sacrament of <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6.</note> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm he received in infancy, which he looked back to in age to anſwer his ingagements, and claim his priviledges; The Lords <note n="b" place="margin">John 7.37. &amp; 6.48.</note> Supper he accounted part of his Souls food: to which he laboured to keep an appetite. <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16</note> He eſteemed it an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of neareſt Communion with Chriſt, and ſo requiring moſt <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28.</note> exact preparation. His firſt care was in the <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.2, 13.</note> examination of himſelf: yet as an act of <note n="f" place="margin">Rev. 2.2.</note> office or charity, he had an eye on others.</p>
            <p>He endeavoured to have the ſcandalous <note n="g" place="margin">Rev. 2.25.</note> caſt out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: but he <note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 16.6.</note> caſt not out himſelf, becauſe the ſcandalous were ſuffered by the negligence of others. He condemned <note n="i" place="margin">Acts 13.12. 1 Cor. 7.5.</note> that ſuperſtition and vanity of Popiſh mock-faſts, yet negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted not one occaſion to humble his ſoul by right faſting: <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 15.8.</note> He abhorred the Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>opus oper atum,</hi> in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in practiſe reſted in <note n="l" place="margin">John 4.23, 24.</note> no performance; but what was done in ſpirit and truth. He thought God had left a Rule in his Word for <note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 3.2, 5, 6.</note> Diſcipline, which he judged pertaining not to the being, but well-being of a Church. He eſteemed thoſe Churches moſt pure, where the Government is by Elders, yet unchurched not thoſe where it was otherways. Perfection <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.17, 18, 19. Rev. 2.14, 20.</note> in Churches he thought a thing rather to be deſired than obtained. And ſo he expected not a Church ſtate without all defects. The <note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.2. Rev. 2.5. Ezek. 5.4.</note> corruptions that were in Churohes he thought his duty to bewail, with endeavours of amendment: yet would he not <note n="r" place="margin">Heb. 10.25. John 4.11.</note> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, where he might partake in the worſhip, and not in the corruption. He put not <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.8.</note> holineſs in Churches, as in the Temple of the Jews; but onely counted them convenient like their Synagogues. He would have them kept <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40.</note> decent, not magnificent; knowing that the Goſpel requires not outward pomp. His chiefeſt muſick was <note n="u" place="margin">James 5.13.</note> ſinging of Pſalms: wherein though he neglected not the melody of the voice, yet he chiefly looked after that of the <note n="x" place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> heart. He diſliked ſuch <note n="y" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.26</note> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſick as moved ſenſual delight, and was an hindrance to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual inlargements. He accounted <note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 13.1. James 1.27.</note> ſubjection to the higher Powers to be part of pure Religion, as well as to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and widows: yet did he diſtinguiſh between authority and luſts of Magiſtrates; to that he ſubmitted, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.23.</note> but in theſe he durſt not be a ſervant of men, being bought with a price. <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> Juſt Laws and Commands he willingly obeyed, not onely for fear, but for Conſcience alſo; but ſuch as were unjuſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obſerve, chuſing <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 4.19.</note> rather to obey God than man: yet his refuſal was <note n="d" place="margin">Jer. 26.14, 15.</note> modeſt and with ſubmiſſion to penalties, unleſs he could procure indulgence from Authority. He was careful in all relations to know and do duty, and that with <note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 5.21, 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſingleneſs of heart as unto Chriſt. He accounted <note n="f" place="margin">Col. 3.22.</note> Religion an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to duty, that the beſt Chriſtians ſhould be beſt husband, beſt wives, beſt parents, beſt children, beſt maſters, beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, beſt Magiſtrates, beſt Subjects, that the <note n="g" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.1. Titus 2.9, 10. 1 Pet. 3.1, 2, 3. Titus 3.1. Mat. 17.27.</note> doctrine of God might be adorned <note n="h" place="margin">Col. 4.15.</note> not blaſphemed. His family he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make a Church, both in regard of <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 101.2, 6, 7.</note> perſons and exerciſes, admitting none into it but ſuch as feared God, and labouring that thoſe that were born in it, might be born again to God. He <note n="k" place="margin">1 Chr. 16.43.</note> bleſſed his family morning and evening, by the Word and Prayer, and took care to perform thoſe Ordinances in the beſt ſeaſon. He brought up his Children in the nurture and <note n="l" place="margin">Eph. 6.4.</note> admonition of the Lord, and commanded his <note n="m" place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> ſervants to keep the way of the Lord. He ſet up <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> diſcipline in his family as he deſired it in the Church, not onely reproving, <note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 3.13.</note> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining vileneſs in his. <note n="p" place="margin">Tit. 2.21, 12.</note> He was conſcientious <note n="q" place="margin">Prov. 11.1.</note> of equity as well as piety: knowing that <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 1.17.</note> unrighteouſneſs is abomination as well as ungodlineſs. He was cautelous in promiſing, <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſalm 15. 4.</note> but careful in performing, counting his word no leſs engagement than his bond. He was a man of a tender heart, not onely in regard of his <note n="t" place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note> own ſin, but others <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 10.33, 37.</note> miſery, not counting mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 25.34, 35.
